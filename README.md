# KT0803

Arduino Library for KT0803 and KT0803K FM transmitter.


### Legal point of attention

In different countries there are different laws with respect to using transmitting devices 
and their range. 
Please inform yourself of the local rules and laws if and how you may or may not use a 
device like the KT0803 in your projects, either hobby, commercial or otherwise.


## Description

This **experimental** library allows basic control of the KT0803 and / or the KT0803K 
FM transmitter device.
It is primary written to understand the possibilities and the interface of the device.

The library is not tested by me with hardware yet. See future below.

There are newer, more capable, follow up devices like model K, L and M.
From these only the KT0803K is supported since 0.2.0. 
The L and the M version are not supported yet (first get K done).
First investigations indicate M == K and L >> K, and thus far they seem backwards compatible.


#### Hardware

Read datasheet for details.

**Warning**
The KT0803 is an 3.3 Volt device and cannot be connected directly to 5V MCU's.


```
                   +----------+
                   |  KT0803  |
             GND --|  1   16  |-- PA_OUT  RF analog output
   Crystal    XI --|  2   15  |-- GND
   Crystal    XO --|  3   14  |-- SCL     I2C Clock
   3.3V    IOVDD --|  4   13  |-- SCA     I2C Data
             GND --|  5   12  |-- GND
   in left   INL --|  6   11  |-- GND
   in right  INR --|  7   10  |-- RSTB    Reset
   enable     SW --|  8    9  |-- GND
                   |          |
                   +----------+
```


#### Frequency range

The frequency range stated on the front page of the datasheet ==> 70 MHz - 108 MHz.
The frequency range stated in table 2 ==> 76 MHz - 108 MHz.
So the datasheet is at least ambiguous on this point.

Keep in mind that the frequency range allowed differs per country.
The library does not provide this filtering, explicit responsibility of the user.


#### Differences

The KT0803K device has far more options, which are not all implemented.
There is one important, the resolution or step-size of the frequency.

|  device   |  step-size  |  Notes  |
|:---------:|:-----------:|:--------|
|  KT0803   |  100 KHz    |  in code all math is done with 50 KHz
|  KT0803K  |   50 KHz    |

Backwards compatible.
According to the datasheet code for the KT0803 should work for the KT0803K.
Code with the KT0803K class will probably not work on a KT0803.


#### Transmit frequency

The transmit frequency can be set with **setFrequency(MHz)** or by **setChannel(channel)**.
Note that the channel and frequency math of the KT0803 and the KT0803K is aligned 
in this library. This allows exchange of channel data between device types.

Note that the KT0803 will internally round to use 100 KHz steps.

Some examples:

|  Frequency   |  Channel  |  Notes  |
|:------------:|:---------:|:-------:|
|   70.00 MHz  |   1400    |  channel = freq (Mhz) \* 20
|   70.05 MHz  |   1401    |  freq = channel \* 0.05
|   70.10 MHz  |   1402    |
|   76.00 MHz  |   1520    |
|   80.00 MHz  |   1600    |
|   89.70 MHz  |   1794    |  default (see registers datasheet)
|  100.00 MHz  |   2000    |
|  101.30 MHz  |   2026    |
|  105.70 MHz  |   2114    |
|  108.00 MHz  |   2160    |

## Interface KT0803

```cpp
#include "KT0803.h"
```

#### Constructor

- **KT0803(TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** constructor, 
optional Wire interface.
- **KT0803K(TwoWire \*wire = &Wire)** constructor, 
optional Wire interface.
- **bool begin(float freq = 90.0, bool mute = true)** initializes the library.
Furthermore it checks if the deviceAddress is available on the I2C bus.
Default it sets the frequency to 90 MHz and **mutes the signal**.
Returns true if deviceAddress is found on the bus, false otherwise.
- **bool isConnected()** test to see if deviceAddress is found on the I2C-bus.


#### Frequency

- **bool setFrequency(float MHz)** converts the frequency in MHz to 
call **setChannel(channel)**. The value of channel is rounded off depending 
on the resolution of the device.
Returns false if MHz is out of range or **setChannel()** fails.
- **float getFrequency()** returns the current frequency in MHz, can be slightly different
from the set value due to rounding math mentioned above.
The return value is derived from a call to **getChannel()**
- **bool setChannel(uint16_t channel)** writes the channel to broadcast on to the device.
This involves two or three writes to different device registers.
- **uint16_t getChannel()** reads the selected channel from the device and 
returns it.


#### PGA

Read Datasheet.

The KT0803K has a **PGA_LSB** (2 bits) setting, which allows setting the gain
with single (1) dB steps. This is not yet implemented in the library.

- **bool setPGA(uint8_t pga)** sets gain according to table below.
Returns false if pga is out of range (0..7).
- **uint8_t getPGA()** returns 0..7, default 0.


|  PGA  |  gain   |  notes  |
|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|
|  111  |  12dB   |
|  110  |   8dB   |
|  101  |   4dB   |
|  100  |   0dB   |
|  000  |   0dB   |  default 
|  001  |  -4dB   |
|  010  |  -8dB   |
|  011  |  -12dB  |


#### RFGain

Read Datasheet.

Note: the RFGain value (4 bits) is distributed over three registers.
PA_BIAS (register 0x05) is only supported in the KT0803K device.
It is not yet supported in the library.

- **bool setRFGain(uint8_t rfgain)** sets rfgain according to table below.
Returns false if rfgain is out of range (0..15).
- **uint8_t getRFgain()** returns 0..15, default 15.


|  RFGAIN  |   RFout      |  PA_BIAS = 1 |  notes  |
|:--------:|:------------:|:------------:|:-------:|
|   0000   |   95.5 dBuV  |      -       |
|   0001   |   96.5 dBuV  |      -       |
|   0010   |   97.5 dBuV  |      -       |
|   0011   |   98.2 dBuV  |      -       |
|   0100   |   98.9 dBuV  |      -       |
|   0101   |  100.0 dBuV  |      -       |
|   0110   |  101.5 dBuV  |      -       |
|   0111   |  102.8 dBuV  |      -       |
|   1000   |  105.1 dBuV  |  107.2 dBuV  |
|   1001   |  105.6 dBuV  |  108.0 dBuV  |
|   1010   |  106.2 dBuV  |  108.7 dBuV  |
|   1011   |  106.5 dBuV  |  109.5 dBuV  |
|   1100   |  107.0 dBuV  |  110.3 dBuV  |
|   1101   |  107.4 dBuV  |  111.0 dBuV  |
|   1110   |  107.7 dBuV  |  111.7 dBuV  |
|   1111   |  108.0 dBuV  |  112.5 dBuV  |  default


#### Region selection

Read datasheet for details.

Note that not all frequencies are allowed in all regions / countries!

The first four are convenience wrappers for **setPHTCNST()**
If some region is missing please let me know the details and I can add 
a wrapper for it.

- **void setEurope()**
- **void setAustralia()**
- **void setUSA()**
- **void setJapan()**
- **bool setPHTCNST(bool on)** See table below.
- **bool getPHTCNST()** returns set value.

|  PHTCNST  |  time   |  Region  |
|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|
|    0      |  75 μs  |  USA, Japan, (default)
|    1      |  50 μs  |  Europe, Australia


#### PilotToneAdjust

Read datasheet.

- **bool setPilotToneAdjust(uint8_t mode)**  HIGH = 1 LOW = 0
- **uint8_t getPilotToneAdjust()**


#### Mute

Default the device is not muted, but **begin()** will default mute it.
See interface section above.

- **bool setMute(bool mute)** enables or disables the transmitting
by muting the signal.
- **bool getMute()** returns the current state of muting.


## Preference channels

The device and library do not implement the persistant store of user 
selectable preferences (frequencies or channels).
This can be implemented by the user in EEPROM or another persistent medium.

Think of a class that holds an array of channels and optional descriptions.
A minimal hardcoded preset sketch is in the examples.


## Derived classes

Since 0.2.0 the KT0803K class is created, although minimally implemented.

The KT0803L might work as it seems backwards compatible. It has far more
registers in use than the KT0803/K.
At the moment there is no intention to implement this KT0803L version.

The KT0803M looks almost identical to the KT0803K (no new registers), so
a derived class is straightforward.


## Interface KT0803K

Added in 0.2.1 (not tested), check datasheet.

#### Mono Stereo

- **bool setMono()** idem
- **bool setStereo()** idem
- **bool isStereo()** idem

#### Bass

- **bool setBass(uint8_t bass);  //  0..3 = 0, 5, 11, 17 dB
- **uint8_t getBass()** idem

#### Misc

- **bool powerOK()**
- **bool silenceDetected()**


## Future

#### Must

- improve documentation
- buy hardware
- test and verify.


#### Should

- add examples for KT0803K specific functions.


#### Could

- RESET pin as optional parameter in constructor?
- SW pin (ON/OFF) as optional parameter in constructor?
  - add functions for sw on/off, 
  - what is impact on settings? 
  - call begin () again? => default
  - explain well doc.
- derived class KT0803M  == KT0803K
- derived class KT0803L  >> KT0803K (compatible)
- improve error handling
- unit tests possible?
- extend settings upon request **bold** are interesting, see table

#### Wont (for now)

- investigate tea5767 FM receiver (Out of scope for this lib).
- implement KT0803L
- investigate efficiency of register access.
  - caching all (allowed) registers in **begin()**
    -  3 bytes for KT0803
    - 12 bytes for KT0803K
  - cache frequency.
  - only writing is needed. 
- send binary data over FM?
- preset frequency array in .h file (hardcoded)
- enums for parameters - readability?
